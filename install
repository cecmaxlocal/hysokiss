Okay, the request "Install IDE Kiss Visual Basic and Creator Freebasic Extension *.bas *.bin *.inc *.rc *.bin" sounds like you're looking for installation instructions for the IDEKiss environment, specifically how to get it set up to handle Visual Basic and FreeBASIC files with those specified extensions.

However, as an AI, I don't have direct access to "install" software on your computer or provide real-time installation processes for a specific, custom IDE like "IDEKiss" unless it's a widely known, publicly available tool with documented installation steps I can reference.

**To give you the most accurate and helpful installation guidance, I would need more information about IDEKiss itself:**

1.  **Is IDEKiss a real, existing IDE you're using, or is it a concept you're developing?**
    *   **If it's an existing IDE:** Where can one download it? Is there an official website, a GitHub repository, or a documentation page?
    *   **If it's a concept/project you're working on:** Then "installation" would involve setting up your development environment, compiling your IDEKiss components, and configuring file associations.

2.  **What operating system are you using?** (Windows, Linux, macOS) Installation steps can vary significantly.

3.  **Are Visual Basic and FreeBASIC already installed on your system?** IDEKiss would likely need these compilers/runtimes to be present.

**General steps for installing and configuring an IDE to handle these file types would typically involve:**

*   **Downloading IDEKiss:** Obtain the installer or executable files.
*   **Running the Installer:** Follow the on-screen prompts.
*   **Configuring File Associations:** The IDE might automatically associate `.bas`, `.bin`, `.inc`, `.rc` files with itself. If not, you'd do this manually through your OS settings.
*   **Setting up Compilers/Interpreters:** Point IDEKiss to the locations of your Visual Basic (if applicable, e.g., VB6 runtime) and FreeBASIC compilers.
*   **Installing Extensions/Plugins:** If IDEKiss uses an extension system, you might need to install specific plugins for enhanced VB/FreeBASIC support.

**Could you provide more details about IDEKiss, or are you looking for a generic guide on how one might set up an IDE for these languages?**

In the meantime, I can show you an image that visually represents the concept of software installation or an IDE being set up.
